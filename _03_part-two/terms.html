					This is <b>not</b> a real legal document and it is not to be used in court.
				</p>
				<h5>NOTICE OF ARBITRATION PROVISIONS:</h5>
				<p>
				Your use of our Site or other Service is subject to binding individual arbitration of any disputes which may arise, as provided in Paragraph 18 below. Please read the arbitration provisions carefully and do not use our Site or other Service if you are unwilling to arbitrate any disputes you may have with us as provided below.
				</p>
				<h5>1. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS</h5>
				<p>These Terms of Use ("Terms") set forth the terms and conditions that apply to your use of www.Estrella Theater.com or any of our other websites (collectively, the "Site") and any other services or products and any related software applications (collectively, the "Service") offered and/or operated by Estrella Theater, LLC ("Estrella Theater" or "we" or "our" or "us").

				<h5>7. MONITORING</h5>
				<p>Estrella Theater may, but has no obligation to, monitor the use of the Site or other Service by members. During monitoring, information may be examined, recorded, copied, and used for authorized purposes in accordance with the Estrella Theater's Privacy Policy. Furthermore, Estrella Theater reserves the right at all times to disclose any information posted on any portion of the Site or other Service as necessary to satisfy any law, regulation or governmental request, or to refuse to post, or to remove, any information or materials, in whole or in part, that in Estrella Theater's sole and absolute discretion are objectionable or in violation of these Terms.</p>
				<h5>8. GRANT OF LIMITED LICENSE</h5>
				<p>If you post any content to the Site or other Service, you hereby grant Estrella Theater and its affiliates and licensees a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive right and license to use, reproduce, publicly display, publicly perform, modify, sublicense, and distribute such content, and incorporate it in other works, in whole or in part, in any manner and any media now known or hereafter developed. You represent and warrant that you own such content or otherwise have sufficient rights in the content to grant to Estrella Theater the foregoing license without infringing or violating the rights of any third party.</p>
				<h5>9. COPYRIGHTS</h5>
				<p>Estrella Theater respects the intellectual property of others, and we ask our users to do the same. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the "Act") provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. Estrella Theater, pursuant to the Act, reserves the right, but not the obligation, to terminate your license to use the Site or other Service if it determines in its sole and absolute discretion that you are involved in infringing activity, including alleged acts of first-time or repeat infringement, regardless of whether the material or activity is ultimately determined to be infringing. Therefore, in compliance with the Act, if you believe that any such third party materials infringe your intellectual property rights, please send a notice to the agent identified below to request a review of the alleged infringement. The notice must include the following information (a) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; (b) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works located on the Site or other Service are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works); (c) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow Estrella Theater to locate the material on the Site or other Service; (d) the name, address, telephone number and email address (if available) of the complaining party; (e) a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or the law; and (f) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send Estrella Theater a counter-notice. Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see http://www.loc.gov/copyright for details. Notices and counter-notices with respect to the Site or other Service should be sent to: Estrella Theater, LLC, DMCA Takedown Notice Process, Attn: General Counsel, 12200 W. Olympic Boulevard, Suite 400, Los Angeles, CA 90064. Estrella Theater suggests that you consult your legal advisor before filing a notice or counter-notice. Also, please be aware that there can be penalties for false claims under the DMCA.</p>
				<h5>10. PROPRIETARY RIGHTS</h5>
				<p>Estrella Theater owns all right, title and interest in and to the Site or other Service and all materials and content contained in the Site or other Service, including, without limitation, all content, site design, logos, button icons, images, digital downloads, data compilations, text, and graphics are protected by copyright, trademark and other intellectual property laws. Any unauthorized use of such materials or content is strictly prohibited.</p>
