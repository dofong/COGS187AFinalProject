<h2>Equal Opportunity Policy</h2>

<p>It is Estrella's policy to employ, retain, promote, terminate and otherwise treat any and all associates and job applicants on the basis of merit, qualifications and competence.

<h2>Commitment to Diversity</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p>Imagine what would happen if we decided to only show films of the same genre. Crazy thought, right? At Estrella, that would never happen – we’re proud to always offer an array of diverse films.</p>
<p>We also feel the same way about our people. For us, diversity goes far beyond the common definition of the word. We look to employ people of many different backgrounds, generations, traditions and philosophies in our workforce – both at our theatres and in our home office. We recognize that one way to diversify is to actively seek associates, vendors, partners and service providers who can enhance our commitment to a diverse Estrella family.</p>
<p>We also recognize that diversity is important to our vision to be known for our commitment to Innovation. The diversity of our workforce helps bring new ideas, perspectives and paradigms to the table that might not otherwise be there. Our associates bring the history and heritage of their respective communities to work with them every day, and each person adds a unique set of skills, talents and beliefs to our world-class Estrella team.</p>
<p>So you can see why, at Estrella, diversity within our team is as important as our commitment to providing theatre guests with the best possible out-of-home entertainment experience – and why we’re committed to employing a team that is truly as diverse as the entertainment on our screens.</p>
