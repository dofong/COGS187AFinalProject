	<h2>Websites in the Wild</h2>

		<h4><a href="https://www.arclightcinemas.com/">https://www.arclightcinemas.com/</a></h4>
		<p>The style of the website is classical and professional. It uses dark colors and dark background of theater curtains, the whole impression is calm and quiet. And it designed very clear "Now Playing", "Coming Soon" section that offers direct and straightforward information about the films on screen. However, despite of those somewhat elegant style, it has some flaws. First of all the navigation bar is oversimplified such that users would have a hard time figuring out what they mean. The checkout process is redundant. And the texts of all the description pages are all relatively small such that sometimes it is hard to find the links.</p>

		<h4><a href="https://www.amctheatres.com/">https://www.amctheatres.com/</a></h4>
		<p>This site gives users a impression of: creativity, energy, and dynamic. It has simplified design with light and a few colors, mainly the color of red and light blue. And they are all pure colors. In addition, there are many details about interactivity, such as when the mouse hangs on one picture, the picture will have a smooth amplifing animation, which is also a "smooth" experience. Besides, its navigation clearly identifies distinct tasks, it is easier to find various services. Its checkout process is simplified; there are also improvement in details like the graphics of seat selections, process indicator, address and direction right in the home page slide view. Overall, it is a good website. Something  bad I found was that it is hard to go back during the checkout process, which may disobey the 10 heuristics.</p>

		<h4><a href="http://fleurcinema.com/">Fleur Cinema & Cafe</a></h4>
		<p>This website is visually beatiful for a small-scale Cinema site. They have a clear brand, with consistent warm colors and excellent handling of white space across their site. They don'th have anything like membership, although they do organize information about films very well and in an appealing manner. They also lead the user to simple information about the theater, like FAQs and career options.</p>

		<h4><a href="http://www.goodrichqualitytheaters.com/">Goodrich Quality Theaters</a></h4>
		<p>This website focuses on organizing navigation and providing as many possibilities for the users to choose from on a given page. Menus and secondary menus are made apparent for the user to change focus or get to a page that suits his/her interests more. While it doesn't look as visually appealing as it could be and the brand is lacking, there is a consistent implementation of functionality for the user to take advantage of; a small example is a 'Print Showtimes' functionality on the Showtimes pages, an unnecessary tool that provides a rich user experience.</p>
